# Jeedom

If you want to import long term statistics from a Jeedom instance. This guideline purpose is to prepare your data to a format that the plugin is able to import into Home Assistant.

# 1 - Export from jeedom

Use Jeedom Interface to export CSV files of each statistics you want to import. For this use the following menu: Jeedom->Analysis->History->Configuration->Action->Export it will trigger a download of a css file which includes the statistics contents.

Format looks like (... is not in the file, just to show you different values)

```

```

We see that the time is not full hours which is needed by HA for import and date is not the good format.

# 2 - Prepare data

We see that the time is not full hours which is needed by HA for import and date is not the good format.

Use the python scripts which do the job to build a new CSV which can be imported.

One script [jeedom2homeassistant-puissance.py](jeedom2homeassistant-puissance.py]) has been build for power which provides min/max/mean (with same time the same values as the jeedom export provides only means. It build a good date/time and merge data if more than one is present for one hour). yes mathematically speaking this is ugly to perform a mean but this is enough for basic needs.

And a second one [jeedom2homeassistant-counters.py](jeedom2homeassistant-counters.py]) which compute a state, sum file for TOTAL_INCREASING for Total consumption in kWh.

This scripts can be adapted for temperature or other statistics if needed.
```bash
python3 script.py <input_file> <output_file> <prefix>
```
with prefix the name of the entity you want to import into.

# 3 - Import with homeassistant-statistics

Use the plugin to import your new generated csv

# 4 - Checks

Goes into HA statistics page and verify the imported data.

# 5 - Alternative

https://github.com/patrickvorgers/Home-Assistant-Import-Energy-Data could have been a good alternative to evaluate.
