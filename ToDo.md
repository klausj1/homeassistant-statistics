# ToDos for Export

- Review integration tests and changes

- user documentation
- Merge both todos
- Create version and update real HA, do a quick test

## Later

- Why is export_json and export_tsv so different? Does it make sense or do we need a refactoring?
- state only cannot be imported
- handle_arguments is used in import, but not in export. Should me made consistent
