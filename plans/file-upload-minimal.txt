Under plans you find architecture and plan for import using file upload first, to ease the usage of export and import.

As a very first step, implement a small breakthrough to prove that the concept is working:

Implement minimal Upload View Backend, which just stores the file and sends a return code.

Implement minimal Upload Form View, which
- allows to select a file via file browser, and uploads the file
- calls the import service with fixed parameters (except filename) via a second button

Authentication must already be there, but it should be enough to be logged in in Home Assistant.

action: import_statistics.import_from_file
data:
  delimiter: \t
  decimal: dot ('.')
  datetime_format: "%d.%m.%Y %H:%M"
  unit_from_entity: true
  filename: xx.tsv

returns

Make sure that the Upload Form View can be added to the home assistant, and create a documentation how to do this.
